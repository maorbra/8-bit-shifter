**An 8-bit cyclic shifter** - A register that takes an input of 8 bits and shifts them according to another 3 bits input (for 8 bits shifter you have 8 options to shift the input between 0 to 7 shifts and to represent 8 options we need 3 bits). This chip is a small part of a computer structure with many registers.
 
The 8-bit shifter consists of 24 Mux_1_2 components.  Each mux gets 2 different input bits (A and B) and according to a selection bit input (S), outputs one of the inputs.

You can see here the schematic, the symbol, and the silicon layout design of the mux component. Using the CMOS method (the size of the transistors was computed according to the worst case of resistance).

You can see here the schematic, the symbol, and the silicon layout design of the 8-bit shifter made by the 24 muxes.
